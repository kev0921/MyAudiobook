### App Platform:
My application is a web app and is mainly designed to be used in a web browser.

### Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, TailwindCSS \
Backend: MongoDB, Express, Node.js \
API: OpenAI API (TTS (text-to-speech) model)

### App Intro
My app is called MyAudiobook, and it allows users to turn any body of text into their own audiobook that they can save, download, and listen to.

### Tool Intro
I used Chat GPT and Microsoft Copilot: [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

## Application Explanation

### Functionality:
My application enables users to easily convert text into audio. Users can type in or paste any text—whether it's from online articles, academic papers, or personal notes—and save it as a custom Audiobook object with a title of their choice. With each Audiobook object, users have the option to generate an audio file that reads the uploaded text aloud in a very natural voice. These audio files can be played and replayed as often as desired, and can also be downloaded as an mp3 file. Each Audiobook object is stored in a database for future access and can be deleted at any time. \
This app is ideal for anyone who wants to consume written content hands-free, especially those who enjoy audiobooks but often encounter text-based media, such as news articles or academic papers, that require reading.\
This app solves the problem with some text-based media not having a text-to-speech feature, or a text-to-speech feature that is not usable (unable to read words properly or sounds super robotic and monotone). This can be seen as both an app that promotes accessbility for those who cannot read but can listen, and for those who just want to consume media while doing other activities or would prefer listening rather than reading.

### Development Process:
I used AI to both assist me in the development process as well as play a key role in my application's functionality. I used Chat GPT to give me ideas on how I would structure my project, such as file structure and separating functions from the UI components. Additionally, I used Chat GPT to help remind me of certain JavaScript syntax and ES6 functions that I forgot about, as well as teach me how to setup all the routes and backend Get, Set, Delete, and Update functions, as I tend to forget some of the details. As for Microsoft Copilot, I use a built in addon on VSCode which lets me use Copilot next to my code editor window, and can query my codebase or the current code editor to help generate its response. I mainly use Copilot to help me design the UI and setup the skeleton for a certain component or function that I am creating to save me some time. I also used Copilot a lot to help me find bugs and fix errors in my code, as it has super quick and easy access to my codebase. As for the OpenAI API, I used their Text to Speech model to generate the audio files that read the user's uploaded text in a very natural voice. 

### Usefulness:
The app I created is very useful for students like me who have long articles or papers to read, and would prefer to listen to an audiobook on the walk to school or while doing mundane tasks such as house chores to save a lot 
of their valuable time. I personally found a need for this application when I wanted to listen to an audiobook of an online article that I need to read for my essay while cleaning up my room and doing the laundry. The article didn't have any text to speech functionality and other online software that provides the same text to speech functionality are either really expensive or have such poor voice quality that it becomes difficult to understand and listen to. As mentioned before, this application also makes a lot more text-based media accessible to those who cannot read but can listen.
